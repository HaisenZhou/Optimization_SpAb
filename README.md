# Optimization_SpAb

## Overview
**Optimization_SpAb** is a computational framework designed to optimize random heteropolypeptides (RHPs) as synthetic polyclonal antibodies (SpAbs). This project provides tools and methods for enhancing the binding affinity and selectivity of RHPs through iterative optimization techniques, including **Bayesian optimization** and **genetic algorithms**. The approach enables rapid identification of SpAbs for specific protein targets, with potential applications in diagnostics and therapeutics.

## Features
- **Data-driven optimization** of random heteropolypeptide compositions
- **Synthetic polyclonal antibody (SpAb) design** for selective antigen recognition
- **Integration of Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for enhanced discovery


## Usage
### 1. **Data Preparation**
Ensure your dataset contains the following files:
- **All_data.csv**: The complete dataset including all experimental results
- **Last_iteration.csv**: Data from the previous optimization cycle
- **Random_data.csv**: All random sampling data for optimization

The input data should be formatted as:
- Polymer composition (n Ã— 8 matrix, where n is the number of samples)
- Target protein ELISA results
- Control protein ELISA results

### 2. **Environment Setup**
Create an environment using the provided script:
```bash
conda create --name affinity_optimization python=3.10
conda activate affinity_optimization
pip install botorch pandas quantecon
```

### 3. **Running Optimization**
Specify the parameters in `run_optimization.py` and run the optimization script:
```bash
python run_optimization.py
```
This will execute the Bayesian Optimization and Genetic Algorithm iterations to refine SpAb compositions.

### 4. **Output & Analysis**
The optimization results will be saved in the output directory.
